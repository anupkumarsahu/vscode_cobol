# COBOL - BitLang Extension 

Thank you for using the "unofficial extension for Micro Focus COBOL".

 As time moves onwards so does the releases of OpenText's Micro Focus COBOL products and you should take a look at some of enhancements that have been done in the shinny new 9.0 release.

## Micro Focus™ Visual COBOL & Enterprise Suite 9.0

For developers using Micro Focus products, the latest release 9.0 has been released.

New Features that I think are worth a look are:
 - Support for parameterised sections
 - PERFORM local variables via DECLARE
 - Support for IBM Enterprise COBOL version 6.4 features:
    - Java/COBOL interop via JAVA-CALLABLE
    - COBOL storage sharable via JAVA-SHARABLE
 - New compile time constants
 - Support for debugging .NET programs hosted in WSL2
